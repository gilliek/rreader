# SYNOPSIS

**RReader** is a RSS/Atom feed reader written as a web application in Ruby on
Rails.

While still being in development, it already boasts all basic features you would
expect from a RSS feed reader. It is meant to be self-hosted and is fully Ajax.
The latter means that the web page never needs to be refreshed.
